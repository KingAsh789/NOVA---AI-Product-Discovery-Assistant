# NOVA AI-Product-Discovery-Assistant


NOVA is an AI-powered multi-agent system that helps aspiring dropshippers discover, evaluate, and prepare winning products to sell online. It combines reasoning agents, scoring systems, and trend analysis across multiple platforms.

Project Vision

Many market research websites like PipiAds, AutoDS, and Dropshipspy can show hundreds of potential winning products. All of which have metrics and ads to back up their claim to be sellable. However for new sellers or experienced ones, navigating through the labyrinth of products and data to end up finding one maybe two 'winning product'...only to later on find some data to prove that it is either over saturated or losing trend. 

To eliminate the guesswork in product research, NOVA combines structured scoring, AI reasoning, and user-defined preferences like budget, niche, and skill level to create 3 guranteed winning products. The best thing is that the more the system is used, the more feedback it receives, and the better the recommendations.
